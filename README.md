Creating a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great way to learn the basics of web development. 

This code creates a basic calculator with HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. 

Users can input mathematical expressions and perform calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It's essential to note that this is a simple example, and it doesn't include advanced error handling or 
security measures you might find in a production calculator application.
